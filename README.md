# TouchscreenToggle
Shell script for computers with Wacom digitizers / touch screens to easily toggle touchscreen mapping, for example on multi-head setups with one touchscreen.
The default script cycles through these settings:
```
1. Touch and Wacom both mapped to internal display, touch enabled
2. Wacom mapped to internal display, touch disabled
3. Wacom and touch mapped to external display, touch enabled
```
### Usage:
Map the script to a button or keyboard shortcut in your DE / WM of choice. Press the button.
